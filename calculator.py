# Description:
#   This program calculates the Blood Alcohol Content of a person. The user is prompted to input their age, weight, gender, how many drinks they have had, and how much time has elapsed since they started drinking. Upon input, they are returned an approximate BAC.

# Constants for BAC calculation
MALE_METABOLIC_RATE = 0.68
FEMALE_METABOLIC_RATE = 0.55
# Number required to convert pounds to grams
POUNDS_TO_GRAMS = 454
# Standard US average of alcohol content in 1 drink, measured in grams
GRAMS_OF_ALCOHOL_PER_DRINK = 14
LEGAL_BAC_LIMIT = 0.08
RATE_OF_BAC_DECAY = 0.015
QUIT = "q"

def main():

    weight = weight * POUNDS_TO_GRAMS # Convert weight to grams

    # Set the appropriate metabolic rate based upon gender
    if gender == "M" or gender == "m":
      weight = weight * MALE_METABOLIC_RATE
    elif gender == "F" or gender == "f":
      weight = weight * FEMALE_METABOLIC_RATE

    alcoholConsumed = alcoholConsumed * GRAMS_OF_ALCOHOL_PER_DRINK # Convert drinks to measure pure alcohol in grams

    bloodAlcohol = alcoholConsumed / weight # calculate raw BAC
    bloodAlcohol = bloodAlcohol * 100 # convert blood alcohol from raw number to a percentage
    bloodAlcohol = float(bloodAlcohol - (elapsedTime * RATE_OF_BAC_DECAY)) # account for drop in BAC based on time elapsed
